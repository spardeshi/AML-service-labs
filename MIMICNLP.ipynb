Mr. [**Known lastname 11465**] could not describe any other symptoms of\\n   depression other than her sadness and when asked about his mother\\n   anxiety, spoke about her not wanting to go out being fearful that she\\n   would fall and be unable to get up.\\n   Past addictions history: None known.\\n   Employment status: Disabled.\\n   Legal involvement: None known.\\n   Additional Information:\\n   Patient / Family HX: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 749**] admitted this 55 y/o WWF with hypoxia\\n   and morbid obesity. In meeting with her son, he said that it has been\\n   approximately one year since she had left their home or seen a doctor\\n   and that in the past 2+ weeks she had been unable to get up from the\\n   sofa resulting in her soiling herself.  Until then, Mr. [**Known lastname 11465**] said that\\n   she had been preparing meals and cooking. Mr. [**Known lastname 11465**] spoke about feeling\\n   guilty that he had not been able to get his mother to go and see a\\n   doctor. It took his aunt\\ns intervention insisting that he call 911 that\\n   she was finally brought to hospital.\\n   He said that that his mother has always been\\nbigger than normal.\\n When\\n   he was younger, he said that she was much more active and spoke of her\\n   ability to walk around large amusement [**Doctor Last Name **]. Until a year ago, he\\n   described her as being\\nvery active,\\n talking about her enjoying riding\\n   around in the car.\\n   Financially, Ms. [**Known lastname 11465**] has been collecting SSDI (approximately\\n   $1,200-$1,300/month) for the past 2.5 years; he said he did not know\\n   what her disability was. She had worked until 3-4 years ago at\\n   [**Company **].  Her sister also sends her a monthly check of $1,000 from a\\n   settlement for a work-related health problem of their father\\ns. Mr.\\n   [**Known lastname 11465**], according to his aunt, quit working several months ago as a\\n   manager in a retail store.\\n   Assessment: Mr. [**Known lastname 11465**] says of his relationship with his mother,\\nWe are\\n   very, very close,\\n a connection that appears to be very mutually\\n   interdependent, perhaps explaining his not having been able to request\\n   medical assistance when his mother protested.

Coronal\\nand sagittal reformatted images were generated.\\n\\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Extensive emphysema is noted at\\nthe lung\\nbases. There are a few scattered hypodensities in the liver\\nwhich are too\\nsmall to characterize, as they measure under 1 cm (3:26, 3:30,\\n3:34 and 35).\\nThe portal vein remains patent. There is some vicarious\\nexcretion of contrast into the gallbladder, which is not\\ndistended. The spleen is unremarkable. No pancreatic\\nabnormalities are identified. There is a suggestion of a vague\\n5- cm lesion of the left adrenal, rounded and hypodense (3:18),\\nbut this not fully characterized on this study. The kidneys\\nenhance symmetrically and excrete normally, without\\nhydronephrosis.\\n\\nA nasogastric tube tip is located in the body of the stomach.\\nThe stomach and bowel loops are unremarkable. Bowel loops are\\nnondilated, and no wall\\nthickening is seen. Oral contrast passes to the level of the\\nproximal\\ntransverse colon, and stool and air are seen within the\\nremaining colon.

Slight asymmetry in the psoas muscles is\\nthought to be related to scoliosis.\\n\\nThe abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, with ectasia and\\nmoderately severe atherosclerotic calcification. No mesenteric\\nor retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen.\\n\\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a moderate-to-severe\\namount of\\nartifact related to the patient's right total hip replacement.\\nThere is a\\nFoley catheter within the bladder, which is decompressed.

The spleen, adrenals, and small bowel are normal.\\nMultiple air- fluid levels in the small bowel are present but\\nwithin normal limits. The small bowel is not distended. Along\\nthe midline upper abdominal wall is a 3 cm fat-containing\\ndefect. More inferiorly, there is a large abdominal wall defect.\\nPatient is status post closure of abdominal wall surgery by\\nsecondary intention. Within the subcutaneous tissues of the\\nright anterior abdominal wall is a 10 x 2.4 cm fluid structure.\\nIt demonstrates minimal rim enhancement. This likely represents\\na seroma, but liquefying hematoma or abscess cannot be excluded.\\n\\nCT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid are unchanged\\nwith marked sigmoid diverticulosis. There is marked\\natherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its\\nmajor branches, and surgical clips are present indicating\\nabdominal surgery. Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys\\nare unchanged and likely represent simple cysts. The distal\\nureters and bladder appear normal. A Foley is present within a\\ncompressed bladder. The remaining large bowel is normal caliber.\\nThere is no free fluid in the pelvis. A healed left inferior\\npubic ramus fracture is unchanged. Otherwise the osseous\\nstructures are only remarkable for degenerative disease\\nthroughout the osseous skeleton.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.

There is mild\\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.\\nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion\\nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular\\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular\\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic\\naortic valve prosthesis is present. The gradient was not\\nassessed and the leaflets are not well seen. No aortic\\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting\\nstructures are thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral\\nregurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity\\nof mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]\\nThe tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild\\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve\\nleaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low\\nnormal systolic function. At least moderate mitral\\nregurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\\n\\n[**9-30**]: Repeated echo (unchanged, except for only MILD mitral\\nregurgitation)\\n\\nRADIOLOGY\\n\\n[**9-21**] CT ABDOMEN: Interval development of worsened pulmonary\\nopacities, most pronounced in the right base. This appearance is\\nconcerning for aspiration, with note of reflux of oral contrast\\ninto the esophagus.  Interval development of a large amount of\\nascites throughout the abdomen with decrease in the previously\\nseen free fluid. This may reflect underlying sepsis, CHF or low\\nalbumin state, particularly given the associated anasarca and\\nedematous changes in the bowel as noted above.\\n\\n[**9-22**] US: Successful paracentesis. Approximately 400 cc of clear\\nyellow\\nfluid were recovered & sent for culture.\\n\\n[**9-30**] CT abdomen: 1. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess. 2.\\nFew tubular gas-filled structures within the left liver lobe. It\\nis unclear whether these represent air within the portal venous\\nor biliary system. There is no air within the mesenteric\\nvessels, or loops of intra-abdominal large or small bowel. 3.\\nSlight interval increase in right lower lobe consolidation,\\nconcerning for worsening aspiration. 4. Slight interval increase\\nin bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. 5.\\nSignificant interval decrease in the amount of intra-abdominal\\nascites. Subcutaneous edema persists.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n[**9-21**]: Presented to ED in septic shock.  After CVL placed,\\nnegative echo & abdominal CT showing new ascites, she was\\nadmitted to the SICU for resuscitation and reversal of her\\nsupratherapeutic INR.\\n\\n[**9-22**]: Diagnostic paracentesis showed serous inflammatory ascitic\\nfluid, and the patient was taken for ex lap & abdominal washout.\\n A diffuse inflammatory process awas encountered, but no frank\\ninfectious collections were seen.  The previously gastrostomy\\ntube was removed & the gastrotomy site was oversewn.\\n\\nShe remained in SICU postop, and was weaned off pressors &\\nventilatory support.  Her extended SICU course is summarized\\nbelow according an organ systems.\\n\\nNEURO: Her pain was controlled with small doses of morphine &\\nher agitation was controlled with ativan & seroquel.\\n\\nCV: Echocardiograms showed good cardiac function, with mild\\nmitral regurgitation. Initially she required pressors to\\nmaintain her blood pressure, but she has been hemodynamically\\nstable for some time.\\n\\nRESP: She was maintained on assist control ventilation & at\\ndischarge was on with fiO2 0.4 & PEEP [**6-13**].  Each day, she\\ntolerated about 4 hours of CPAP with PSV towards the end of her\\nadmission.\\n\\nFEN/GI: Abdominal pain gradually improved after surgery.\\nInitial fluid avidity resolved after surgery & she was diuresed\\ndown to her baseline weight of 55kg.  Was fed with impact via\\nnasogastric dobhoff tube.  Hypernatremia treated with free water\\nboluses. Patient had an GI bleed from a hemorrhoid which caused\\nus to stop anticoagulation for L subclavian DVT.\\n\\nHEME: INR was reversed with vitamin K & FFP prior to [**9-22**]\\nparacentesis.  Prior to discharge, she was re-anticoagulated\\nwith lovenox & coumadin for her L subclavian DVT.\\nAnticoagulation was stopped due to GI bleed.\\n\\nID: treated x 2 weeks with vanc/ceftaz/flagyl for her\\nperitonitis.

Since his admission, the patient's\\ndiarrhea and fevers had progressively improved on cefepime,\\nvancomycin, and metronidazole as well as Lomotil.  Since then\\nhis course has been complicated by a steadily declining\\nhematocrit (33 to 25 over the admission), worsening\\nthrombocytopenia, and a new coagulopathy (INR up to 5.4).  On\\n[**10-12**], he was noted to be hypoxemic and had chest x-ray showing\\nonly a distended stomach and a CTA with no PE (but also a\\ndistended stomach and known liver mets).  ABG was 7.44/25/63\\nthen 7.32/21/84 that afternoon.  His oxygen requirement waxed\\nand waned, from mid 80's on room air to mid 90's on room air.\\nHis hypoxemia persisted and the patient became increasingly\\ntired, confused, and tachypneic.  A repeat ABG was 7.3/19/75 but\\nhis lactate had climbed from 3.5 to 8.0. He was transferred to\\nthe ICU at which time he was fatigued and appeared disoriented.\\nIn this setting, he denied pain (including abdominal) as well as\\ndyspnea despite obvious tachypnea and mild accessory muscle use.\\nHe was started on IVF with 3 amps bicarb, lactate trended down,\\nacidosis resolving. CT abdomen showed SBO with no obvious cut\\noff for obstruction a NGT placed and medical management\\nrecommeneded by surgery. Primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\\ncontinued to follow.\\n  In the ICU he was found to have guiaic positive NGT\\nsecretions.  He was transfused PRBCs for a dropping HCT.  In\\naddition he was noted to have an elevated INR for which he was\\ntreated with FFP.  He was evaluated by surgery who felt him to\\nbe a poor surgical candidate.  For his confusion a CT of his\\nhead was performed which was negative for bleed or other change.\\n His hypoxia resolved and was felt to be due to aspiration\\ninitially.  He was treated with TPN given his poor nutritional\\nstatus.  He was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with no\\nimprovement.  On [**2120-10-18**] a family meeting was held at which\\ntime it was decided that the goal of care was maximal comfort.\\nAt that meeting it was decided to continue with fluids and\\nanalgesia but to limit other medications and TPN.  The family\\nwill provide Chinese herbs and prayer.\\n.\\n# GI: Diarrhea was believed to be chemo-induced diarrhea.  The\\npatient was covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl given\\nneutropenic fever.  The CT of abdomen on admission did not show\\nany inflammatory processes in the abdomen. The patient was given\\nsupportive care with IVF and Lomotil once obtained stool samples\\nfor cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved with\\nlomotil.  However, patient became acidotic and CT abdomen was\\nrepeated and revealed SBO. NGT was placed and surgey was\\nconsulted but did not feel that the patient was a good surgical\\ncandidate. Patient was continued on medical management.\\nOctreotide was added to his regimen to help to relieve\\nobstruction. His lactate continued to trend down and NGT outout\\nbegan to slow. Patient denied any abdominal pain.\\n    However, while in the ICU he developed bloody stools in the\\nsetting of coagulopathy. This was felt to be likely secondary to\\nhis rectal cancer. He was tranfused pRBCs and FFP. After several\\nbloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel\\nmovements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit was\\nstable.\\n.\\nCoagulopathy: Likely DIC secondary to cancer. He devloped GI\\nbleed as mentioned above and was transfused several units of FFP\\nand pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets. By tranfer from the ICU his\\nHCT and INR was stable but platelets were 34. The patient and\\nfamily did not want any further transfusions as their goal was\\ncomfort and this would require daily monitoring of his CBC and\\ncoags.\\n.\\n# NEUTROPENIC FEVER: The patient was started on cefepime, vanco,\\nand flagyl on admission. He had some fevers early in his\\nhospitalization but remained afebrile for the rest of his\\nadmission. He because hypoxic and acidotic and a CT chest was\\notained which revealed likely aspiration/pneumonia. He was\\ncontinue on his antibiotics to complete a 14 day course and\\nreceived daily neupogen injections. By the 11th day of his\\nantibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic. His neupogen was\\ndiscontinued and he remained afebrile.\\n\\n# AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: concerning for lactic acidosis [**1-24**] to\\nhypovolemia.  Patient refused central line/sepsis protocol in\\nED. He was  hemodynamically stable on transfer to the floor.\\nLactate normalized after IVF. Then the patient continued to have\\nnon-anion gap acidosis [**1-24**] to diarrhea.  ABG was obtained and\\nthe patient appropriately compensated with decreased CO2 (25)\\nwith normal pH 7.4-7.44. He then became more hypoxic and acidotc\\nand was tranferred to the ICU. In the ICU it was discoved that\\nhe had an extremely dilated stomach and SBO. It was felt that\\nthe lactic acidosis ,may have been secondary to the extreme\\ndistension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactate\\non decompression with NGT. His gap closed and his lactate\\nconitnued to tened down.\\n.\\n# RECTAL CANCER: Last chemotherapy was last avastin/5FU on [**9-25**].\\nGiven that he did not tolerate this well, no further\\nchemotherapy was planned. He also developed what is believed to\\nbe lower GI bleed, SBO and DIC during admission all which were\\nthaough to be related to his metastatic disease. Due to his poor\\nprognosis and worsening medical condition a family meeting was\\nheld and the family and patient agreed that comfort was the most\\nimportant goal at this point. He was continued on IVF and the\\nNGGT was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his SBO.\\nIt was decided that no further blood products would be given.\\n.\\nFEN: Patient was actively hydrated in the setting of diarrhea\\nand acidosis. He was continued on IVF given his SBO. Given his\\npoor prognosis and that comfort was the goal, he was not started\\non TPN, but rather hydrated with IVF in the setting of SBO.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

She recommended\\nrepeating her serum tryptase, ordering a 24 hr urine histamine,\\nand if possible performing an aspirin challenge in house.  Serum\\ntryptase revealed a high value at 84. The patient has a\\nparticularly high level of urine prostaglandins, making aspirin\\ntherapy an ideal treatment.  Unfortunately, she had a possible\\nflare [**3-4**] aspirin in [**2136**].  The challenge was performed the day\\nof admission and an adverse reaction at the maximum aspirin dose\\nresulted in an ICU course.

She recommended\\nrepeating her serum tryptase, ordering a 24 hr urine histamine,\\nand if possible performing an aspirin challenge in house.  Serum\\ntryptase revealed a high value at 84.

The patient has had  several prior\\nhospitalizations, most recently [**10-6**], for mastocytosis. The\\npatient stated that 3 days ago she began to notice increasing\\nflushing with palpitations and generalized pruritus. She took\\nP.O. Prednisone at home with some improvement in her symptoms\\nthe following day. A day later, however, these aforementioned\\nsymptoms returned along with nausea and she decided to go to ED.\\n No recent clear precipitants. She denies fevers, sick contacts\\nbut has been traveling more recently.\\n\\nIn the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR in 150s with EKG showing\\nsinus tachycardia. She was given IV Solumedrol 125 mg, Phenergan\\n25 mg IV X 2, and Ativan 1 mg IV X 3, Zofran 4 mg IV X 2,\\nBenadryl 50 mg IV X 2, Tylenol 650 mg po X 1, and 3L IVFs before\\nadmission.\\n\\nUpon arrival to the medical inpatient floor, the patient's\\nstatus declined and she developed HR 160-170s, SBP 80s, and\\nworsening nausea and vomiting. Pt had poor access.  Patient was\\nthen transferred to the MICU. n MICU, attempted multiple times\\nto obtain U/S guided PIV, then placed R femoral TLC as patient\\nunable to reliably lie flat for IJ or SCV line due to wretching,\\nnausea and vomiting. Patient had multiple episodes of coffee\\nground emesis. NGT placement was attempted several times without\\nsuccess. Aggressive IVF resusitation continued. Two hours later,\\nthe patient desaturated down to upper 60s despite 100% face\\ntent. Clinically, however, the patient was not cyanotic or\\nexperiencing labored breaths. Corresponding ABG of\\n7.51/32/143/26 confirmed a healthy PaO2 level. CXR was\\nunremakable for any acute cardiopulmonary pathology. Given PaO2\\nand clinical picture of patent airway without wheezes or clear\\ndistress the team decided not to intubate patient. It was felt\\nthat the patient was protected her airway appropriately despite\\naspiration risks given multiple episodes of vomiting. GI\\nconsulted for coffee ground emesis. Most likely etiology for\\nemesis was persistent wretching on the day of admission.  Given\\nthat the pt's HCT stabilized and no further episodes of emesis\\noccurred it was felt that GI f/u could be obtained as an\\noutpatient.\\n\\nPt was transferred to the floor from the MICU after being seen\\nby her allergist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**].\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History:\\nSystemic mastocytosis\\nAnemia\\nThumb surgery\\nTonsillectomy\\n\\n\\nSocial History:\\nPatient employed as a librarian.

By hospital day 2\\nthe patient's blood pressures ranged between 110-130/60-80s and\\nIVFs were discontinued and PO diet was initiated. Patient\\nadvised to maintain appropriate hydration.\\n\\nSystemic mastocytosis: The patient's acute episode was\\nstabilized with the help of the allergy team's recommendations\\nwhich included IV Solumedrol, Cromolyn and IV Benadryl. A\\ntryptase level was also ordered to assess severity of flare.\\nOnce patient stabilized IV Solumedrol 125 mg IV q12h was\\ndiscontinued and prior home regimen of oral Prednisone 50mg was\\nstarted. Daily Benadryl and Cromolyn were continued and patient\\nsupplemented with additional hydralazine prn.  She was monitored\\nfor any swelling of the airway and EKG changes.\\nThe patient will restart home meds of Singulair, Zyrtec,\\nGastrocrom, and Doxepin on discharge home. Although patient\\ndenies any illness, blood and urine cultures were sent to rule\\nout any underlying triggers for mastocytosis exacerbation.\\n\\nHypoxia: During acute phase of mastocytosis exacerbation\\ndesaturated to 60s on high flow face tent but PaO2 on ABG much\\nmore reassuring with levels >100. Furthermore, patient was\\nwithout any signs of acute respiratory distress;no lung\\ncrackles/wheezes, no SOB, non-elevated JVD on PE. After acute\\nattack controlled the patient was consistently >95% on low flow\\nO2 via NC and then RA.\\n\\nHallucinations and Agitation: After 2 days in hospital on high\\ndose Solumedrol the patient experienced hallucinations and overt\\nagitation most likely [**3-3**] high Solumedrol levels and perhaps\\ncomplicated further by high Diphenhydramine amounts as well. She\\nwas given Ativan PRN orders and Solumedrol switched to lower\\nPrednisone 50mg dose. Patient's mood/emotionality seemed to\\nstabilize after these changes.\\n\\nGI bleed: Initially had multiple episodes of coffee ground\\nemesis which abated by day 2. Patient appears well-perfused and\\nhemodynamically stable despite her anemia history and dilutional\\ndrop in Hgb/Hct values s/p aggressive IVF resuscitation.\\nFollowed Hcts/CBCs and agreed on transfusion cutoff for Hct < 21\\nbut patient's values improved. Continued IV PPI q12h.  GI was\\nconsulted due to episodes of bloody, \\\"coffee ground\\\" emesis on\\nadmission and agreed to follow patient with urgent EGD if she\\nshowed signs of active bleeding but otherwise felt elective EGD\\nonce she is out of the ICU would be a reasonable approach to\\nexplore etiology once patient more stable. Initially the patient\\nwas double covered with H2B and PPIs due to aspiration risks as\\nper GI advice but was later switched to [**Hospital1 **] PPIs alongside\\nPhenergen and Zofran antiemetics.\\n\\nFemoral/Groin pain- patient had a right femoral line placed for\\nemergent access during acute episode as she was writhing and\\nunable to be safely positioned for a central line. After femoral\\nline was removed on day 2 patient c/o pain at removal site of\\nRight Femoral line and was given PO Tylenol for pain. No active\\nbleeding noted after pressure held for >20mins. On PE, femoral,\\npopliteal and pedal pulses all in tact. Hematoma noted at site\\nand dressed and monitored daily for any changes.\\n.\\nLeukocytosis: Rise in WBC likely due to demargination after\\nrecent solumedrol loads as well as underlying mastocytosis\\ninsult. Patient remained afebrile throughout her stay and blood\\nand urine cultures were sent.\\n.\\nFEN: Advanced to PO diet and tolerated well by day 2. No current\\nsigns of active nausea, vomiting or UGI/LGI bleeding.

She was admitted with chest pain on this admission.\\nPreviously, on [**2145-10-9**], she was admitted after a\\nreaction to gadolinium in which she developed severe nausea,\\nand airway tightness, and shortness of breath.  She was given\\nepinephrine and developed severe chest pain.  Serial\\nelectrocardiograms at that time showed ST-T wave changes and\\na troponin of 20 which then decreased to 1.5.  An\\nechocardiogram at that time showed akinesis at the base of\\nfraction of 35%.\\n\\nSince that admission, she has had chest pain every day,\\nusually muscle pain episodes each day.  The pain is worse\\nwith food, and occasionally worse with exercise, and\\noccasionally awakens the patient from sound sleep.  She uses\\nnitroglycerin (two at a time) every two to three days.  She\\nalso gets chest pain which radiates to her back accompanied\\nby occasional shortness of breath.  The chest pain has been\\nworse over the past several days and finally has required her\\nto seek treatment in the Emergency Department.\\n\\nThe patient has chronic abdominal pain which improved on\\nGastrocrom 200 mg p.o. q.i.d. which was increased this Fall\\nfrom 100 mg p.o. q.d.   However, because the patient's\\nabdominal pain was improved she decreased her dose to 100 mg\\nof Gastrocrom q.i.d.   She notes that the Gastrocrom did not\\nhelp her chest pain.  The patient has also been on Vistaril,\\n[**Doctor First Name **], and Zantac for histamine suppression.  On previous\\nhospitalizations, she has required steroids.\\n\\nAdditionally, the patient notes the presence of chills and\\njoint pain.  Her hands have become worse with swelling and\\nerythema since discontinuing her Vioxx at last admission when\\nshe was started on Coumadin for cardiomyopathy.\\n\\nShe denies any fevers or night sweats and has no headaches or\\nchange in her bowels.  She does describe some malaise.  She\\nsays she has not played tennis since her [**Month (only) 359**] admission.\\nShe has a minimal appetite and is forcing herself to eat.\\nShe does say she noted some bright red blood per rectum mixed\\nwith stool that had streaks of dark color on the day of\\nadmission.  The patient does have a history of internal\\nhemorrhoids.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  Cholecystectomy in [**2143**]; followed by a bile leak that was\\ntreated with a stent.  She subsequently had pancreatitis in\\n[**2143-7-3**] and in [**2144**].  She had increased liver function\\ntests, and a sphincterotomy times two.\\n2.  In [**2145-4-3**] she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16164**] procedure (uterine\\nsuspension) followed by increased lipase and liver function\\ntests accompanied by abdominal pain.\\n3.  In [**2145-10-3**], sural nerve biopsy, and endoscopic\\nretrograde cholangiopancreatography muscle biopsy, and liver\\nbiopsy.  Subsequently, multiple admissions for abdominal pain\\naccompanied by increased liver function tests and increased\\namylase and lipase.\\n4.  In [**2147-6-3**], tarsal tunnel release and subsequent\\nneuropathy.\\n5.  In [**2147-7-3**], abdominal pain with scleral icterus.\\n6.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2146-12-13**] showed\\nprominent mass cells with granulation in the duodenum and\\nmild esophagitis.\\n7.

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with a myocardial infarction at the\\nage 76.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and active in sports.\\nTwo children who are well.  The patient is an Emergency Room\\ntechnician.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98,\\nblood pressure was 120/66, heart rate was 60, respiratory\\nrate was 20, oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.  In\\ngeneral, the patient was in pain, holding her chest.  Head,\\neyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed anicteric.\\nErythematous lids.  The mouth was moist without ulcers.  The\\nneck revealed no adenopathy.  The thyroid was normal.\\nCardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and\\nrhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  No\\nmurmurs.  The lungs revealed inspiratory wheezes posteriorly\\non the left.  Expiratory wheezes scattered bilaterally.\\nNormal to percussion.  The abdomen was nondistended with\\ntenderness and guarding in the epigastric region.  Positive\\nbowel sounds.  Rectal examination revealed no stool or blood,\\nnormal tone.  Extremities revealed swelling and tenderness on\\nthe right and left proximal interphalangeal joint and distal\\ninterphalangeal joint, left third distal interphalangeal was\\nwarm to touch.  The patient without lower extremity edema.\\nThere was mild palmar erythema.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories\\nrevealed white blood cell count was 5.1, hematocrit was 34.3,\\nplatelets were 231.  Electrolytes were within normal limits.\\nPT was 17.4, PTT was 32.1, INR was 2.  Creatine kinases and\\ntroponin were normal times three.  ALT was 22, AST was 32,\\namylase was 83, lipase was 93.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT revealed left lung base with a small\\nnodule.  Splenic calcifications.  Normal aorta, celiac,\\nsuperior mesenteric artery, and internal mammary artery\\ntakeoff.  No aneurysm.\\n\\nElectrocardiogram was notable for nonsloping ST-T wave\\nchanges, poor progression in V1 and V2, generally low\\nvoltage.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient's primary issue\\nduring her hospitalization was her chest pain.  She typically\\nhad three episodes of severe debilitating chest pain per day\\nduring her admission.  She described these as 7/10 chest pain\\nin general, radiating to her back, and were accompanied with\\nnausea and dry heaves.  On each occasion during her\\nadmission, an electrocardiogram was obtained, and there was\\nnever any change in her electrocardiograms.\\n\\nHer pain generally resolved with several sublingual\\nnitroglycerin coupled with 2 mg to 4 mg of intravenous\\nDilaudid, and Zofran and Ativan were also frequently\\nrequired.  Her chest pain in general did not seem to improve\\nduring her admission, in that it did not decrease in\\nfrequency or severity.  Her histamine blockade was increased\\nwith her Gastrocrom, and she was started on steroids,\\nhowever, it became evident during her admission that she was\\nthrowing away her prednisone.\\n\\nCardiology was involved and did not feel that her chest pain\\nwas consistent with a cardiac etiology.  An echocardiogram\\nwas obtained and showed that her ejection fraction had\\nrebounded to 75% from 35% on her last admission.\\n\\nAn Allergy consultation was obtained, and there was some\\nsuggestion that histamine release could cause coronary with\\nmuscle spasm; however, this was felt to be somewhat less\\nlikely.   Additionally as her repeat electrocardiogram showed\\nno evidence of ischemia with chest pain, and her cardiac\\nfunction was normal, we felt the patient's cardiovascular\\nstatus was good.\\n\\n2.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  Possible gastrointestinal\\netiology for the patient's symptoms were closely considered.\\nThis was felt to be somewhat likely given the patient's\\nhistory of gastrointestinal manifestations of mast cell\\nactivation.  There was suspicion for esophageal spasm given\\nthe resolution of symptoms with nitroglycerin in the presence\\nof no electrocardiogram changes.\\n\\nGI was involved and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was\\nperformed which was grossly normal.  However, biopsy\\nspecimens were taken.  The patient may still require\\n[**Doctor Last Name **] test in the future for possible esophageal spasm.\\n\\nIn terms of the patient's lower gastrointestinal bleed, a\\nflexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and revealed only\\nhemorrhoids.  The patient's abdominal pain was well\\ncontrolled throughout her admission with histamine blockade\\nand Gastrocrom.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  As the patient's chest pain episodes\\ncontinued throughout her admission, she began to experience\\nincreasing respiratory distress with these episodes.  Her\\nrespiratory issues consisted of wheezing during her chest\\npain episodes and were worrisome for anaphylaxis.\\n\\nOn two occasions, the patient received epinephrine which\\nseemed to help symptoms to some degree.  However, on the\\nsecond occasion, after receiving racemic epinephrine and\\nstill having some stridorous sounds worrisome for\\nanaphylaxis, the patient was transferred to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit for observation.  She was closely\\nobserved there but did not have any further events and was\\nstable from a pulmonary perspective.  It was unclear to what\\nextent her wheezing was related to histamine release and\\nanaphylaxis, as there also seemed to be some anxiety\\ncomponent that was worsening these episodes.\\n\\nHer arterial blood gas after the episode causing the\\nMedical Intensive Care Unit transfer was consistent with some\\ndegree of a panic attack.

She recommended\\nrepeating her serum tryptase, ordering a 24 hr urine histamine,\\nand if possible performing an aspirin challenge in house.  Serum\\ntryptase revealed a high value at 84.

The patient has had  several prior\\nhospitalizations, most recently [**10-6**], for mastocytosis. The\\npatient stated that 3 days ago she began to notice increasing\\nflushing with palpitations and generalized pruritus. She took\\nP.O. Prednisone at home with some improvement in her symptoms\\nthe following day. A day later, however, these aforementioned\\nsymptoms returned along with nausea and she decided to go to ED.\\n No recent clear precipitants. She denies fevers, sick contacts\\nbut has been traveling more recently.\\n\\nIn the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR in 150s with EKG showing\\nsinus tachycardia. She was given IV Solumedrol 125 mg, Phenergan\\n25 mg IV X 2, and Ativan 1 mg IV X 3, Zofran 4 mg IV X 2,\\nBenadryl 50 mg IV X 2, Tylenol 650 mg po X 1, and 3L IVFs before\\nadmission.\\n\\nUpon arrival to the medical inpatient floor, the patient's\\nstatus declined and she developed HR 160-170s, SBP 80s, and\\nworsening nausea and vomiting. Pt had poor access.  Patient was\\nthen transferred to the MICU. n MICU, attempted multiple times\\nto obtain U/S guided PIV, then placed R femoral TLC as patient\\nunable to reliably lie flat for IJ or SCV line due to wretching,\\nnausea and vomiting. Patient had multiple episodes of coffee\\nground emesis. NGT placement was attempted several times without\\nsuccess. Aggressive IVF resusitation continued. Two hours later,\\nthe patient desaturated down to upper 60s despite 100% face\\ntent. Clinically, however, the patient was not cyanotic or\\nexperiencing labored breaths. Corresponding ABG of\\n7.51/32/143/26 confirmed a healthy PaO2 level. CXR was\\nunremakable for any acute cardiopulmonary pathology. Given PaO2\\nand clinical picture of patent airway without wheezes or clear\\ndistress the team decided not to intubate patient. It was felt\\nthat the patient was protected her airway appropriately despite\\naspiration risks given multiple episodes of vomiting. GI\\nconsulted for coffee ground emesis. Most likely etiology for\\nemesis was persistent wretching on the day of admission.  Given\\nthat the pt's HCT stabilized and no further episodes of emesis\\noccurred it was felt that GI f/u could be obtained as an\\noutpatient.\\n\\nPt was transferred to the floor from the MICU after being seen\\nby her allergist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**].\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History:\\nSystemic mastocytosis\\nAnemia\\nThumb surgery\\nTonsillectomy\\n\\n\\nSocial History:\\nPatient employed as a librarian.

By hospital day 2\\nthe patient's blood pressures ranged between 110-130/60-80s and\\nIVFs were discontinued and PO diet was initiated. Patient\\nadvised to maintain appropriate hydration.\\n\\nSystemic mastocytosis: The patient's acute episode was\\nstabilized with the help of the allergy team's recommendations\\nwhich included IV Solumedrol, Cromolyn and IV Benadryl. A\\ntryptase level was also ordered to assess severity of flare.\\nOnce patient stabilized IV Solumedrol 125 mg IV q12h was\\ndiscontinued and prior home regimen of oral Prednisone 50mg was\\nstarted. Daily Benadryl and Cromolyn were continued and patient\\nsupplemented with additional hydralazine prn.  She was monitored\\nfor any swelling of the airway and EKG changes.\\nThe patient will restart home meds of Singulair, Zyrtec,\\nGastrocrom, and Doxepin on discharge home. Although patient\\ndenies any illness, blood and urine cultures were sent to rule\\nout any underlying triggers for mastocytosis exacerbation.\\n\\nHypoxia: During acute phase of mastocytosis exacerbation\\ndesaturated to 60s on high flow face tent but PaO2 on ABG much\\nmore reassuring with levels >100. Furthermore, patient was\\nwithout any signs of acute respiratory distress;no lung\\ncrackles/wheezes, no SOB, non-elevated JVD on PE. After acute\\nattack controlled the patient was consistently >95% on low flow\\nO2 via NC and then RA.\\n\\nHallucinations and Agitation: After 2 days in hospital on high\\ndose Solumedrol the patient experienced hallucinations and overt\\nagitation most likely [**3-3**] high Solumedrol levels and perhaps\\ncomplicated further by high Diphenhydramine amounts as well. She\\nwas given Ativan PRN orders and Solumedrol switched to lower\\nPrednisone 50mg dose. Patient's mood/emotionality seemed to\\nstabilize after these changes.\\n\\nGI bleed: Initially had multiple episodes of coffee ground\\nemesis which abated by day 2. Patient appears well-perfused and\\nhemodynamically stable despite her anemia history and dilutional\\ndrop in Hgb/Hct values s/p aggressive IVF resuscitation.\\nFollowed Hcts/CBCs and agreed on transfusion cutoff for Hct < 21\\nbut patient's values improved. Continued IV PPI q12h.  GI was\\nconsulted due to episodes of bloody, \\\"coffee ground\\\" emesis on\\nadmission and agreed to follow patient with urgent EGD if she\\nshowed signs of active bleeding but otherwise felt elective EGD\\nonce she is out of the ICU would be a reasonable approach to\\nexplore etiology once patient more stable. Initially the patient\\nwas double covered with H2B and PPIs due to aspiration risks as\\nper GI advice but was later switched to [**Hospital1 **] PPIs alongside\\nPhenergen and Zofran antiemetics.\\n\\nFemoral/Groin pain- patient had a right femoral line placed for\\nemergent access during acute episode as she was writhing and\\nunable to be safely positioned for a central line. After femoral\\nline was removed on day 2 patient c/o pain at removal site of\\nRight Femoral line and was given PO Tylenol for pain. No active\\nbleeding noted after pressure held for >20mins. On PE, femoral,\\npopliteal and pedal pulses all in tact. Hematoma noted at site\\nand dressed and monitored daily for any changes.\\n.\\nLeukocytosis: Rise in WBC likely due to demargination after\\nrecent solumedrol loads as well as underlying mastocytosis\\ninsult. Patient remained afebrile throughout her stay and blood\\nand urine cultures were sent.\\n.\\nFEN: Advanced to PO diet and tolerated well by day 2. No current\\nsigns of active nausea, vomiting or UGI/LGI bleeding. Team\\nrepleted electrolytes as needed and  Zofran and Phenergan given\\nfor N/V.\\n\\nPPx: Pneumoboots given for DVT prophylaxis and heparin SC held\\ngiven GI bleed setting, PPIs given for GI PPx\\n\\nAccess: patient had right femoral line in place with PIV during\\nher stay\\n\\nCode: Full Code status\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nCetirizine 10mg PO BID\\nCromolyn 20mg/mL solution, 10mL PO QID\\nDoxepin 50mg PO QAM and 100mg PO QPM\\nEpiPen prn\\nNuvaRing\\nHydroxyzine 30mg PO TID\\nAtivan 0.5mg PO PRN anxiety\\nSingulair 10mg PO Qdaily\\nPrednisone 50mg Qdaily X7 days PRN mastocytosis flare\\nRanitidine 150mg PO BID\\nFerrous sulfate 325mg PO BID\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

She was admitted with chest pain on this admission.\\nPreviously, on [**2145-10-9**], she was admitted after a\\nreaction to gadolinium in which she developed severe nausea,\\nand airway tightness, and shortness of breath.  She was given\\nepinephrine and developed severe chest pain.  Serial\\nelectrocardiograms at that time showed ST-T wave changes and\\na troponin of 20 which then decreased to 1.5.  An\\nechocardiogram at that time showed akinesis at the base of\\nfraction of 35%.\\n\\nSince that admission, she has had chest pain every day,\\nusually muscle pain episodes each day.  The pain is worse\\nwith food, and occasionally worse with exercise, and\\noccasionally awakens the patient from sound sleep.  She uses\\nnitroglycerin (two at a time) every two to three days.  She\\nalso gets chest pain which radiates to her back accompanied\\nby occasional shortness of breath.  The chest pain has been\\nworse over the past several days and finally has required her\\nto seek treatment in the Emergency Department.\\n\\nThe patient has chronic abdominal pain which improved on\\nGastrocrom 200 mg p.o. q.i.d. which was increased this Fall\\nfrom 100 mg p.o. q.d.   However, because the patient's\\nabdominal pain was improved she decreased her dose to 100 mg\\nof Gastrocrom q.i.d.   She notes that the Gastrocrom did not\\nhelp her chest pain.  The patient has also been on Vistaril,\\n[**Doctor First Name **], and Zantac for histamine suppression.  On previous\\nhospitalizations, she has required steroids.\\n\\nAdditionally, the patient notes the presence of chills and\\njoint pain.  Her hands have become worse with swelling and\\nerythema since discontinuing her Vioxx at last admission when\\nshe was started on Coumadin for cardiomyopathy.\\n\\nShe denies any fevers or night sweats and has no headaches or\\nchange in her bowels.  She does describe some malaise.  She\\nsays she has not played tennis since her [**Month (only) 359**] admission.\\nShe has a minimal appetite and is forcing herself to eat.\\nShe does say she noted some bright red blood per rectum mixed\\nwith stool that had streaks of dark color on the day of\\nadmission.  The patient does have a history of internal\\nhemorrhoids.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  Cholecystectomy in [**2143**]; followed by a bile leak that was\\ntreated with a stent.  She subsequently had pancreatitis in\\n[**2143-7-3**] and in [**2144**].  She had increased liver function\\ntests, and a sphincterotomy times two.\\n2.  In [**2145-4-3**] she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16164**] procedure (uterine\\nsuspension) followed by increased lipase and liver function\\ntests accompanied by abdominal pain.\\n3.  In [**2145-10-3**], sural nerve biopsy, and endoscopic\\nretrograde cholangiopancreatography muscle biopsy, and liver\\nbiopsy.  Subsequently, multiple admissions for abdominal pain\\naccompanied by increased liver function tests and increased\\namylase and lipase.\\n4.  In [**2147-6-3**], tarsal tunnel release and subsequent\\nneuropathy.\\n5.  In [**2147-7-3**], abdominal pain with scleral icterus.\\n6.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2146-12-13**] showed\\nprominent mass cells with granulation in the duodenum and\\nmild esophagitis.\\n7.  Additionally, the patient is status post multiple episode\\nof anaphylaxis treated by epinephrine.\\n8.  The patient also has seronegative arthritis.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  COMPAZINE, DROPERIDOL, GADOLINIUM, SULFA.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\\n1.  Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.\\n2.

Cromolyn 100 mg p.o. q.i.d.\\n8.  Vistaril 25 mg p.o. q.h.s.\\n9.  Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with a myocardial infarction at the\\nage 76.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and active in sports.\\nTwo children who are well.  The patient is an Emergency Room\\ntechnician.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98,\\nblood pressure was 120/66, heart rate was 60, respiratory\\nrate was 20, oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.  In\\ngeneral, the patient was in pain, holding her chest.  Head,\\neyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed anicteric.\\nErythematous lids.  The mouth was moist without ulcers.  The\\nneck revealed no adenopathy.  The thyroid was normal.\\nCardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and\\nrhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  No\\nmurmurs.  The lungs revealed inspiratory wheezes posteriorly\\non the left.  Expiratory wheezes scattered bilaterally.\\nNormal to percussion.  The abdomen was nondistended with\\ntenderness and guarding in the epigastric region.  Positive\\nbowel sounds.  Rectal examination revealed no stool or blood,\\nnormal tone.  Extremities revealed swelling and tenderness on\\nthe right and left proximal interphalangeal joint and distal\\ninterphalangeal joint, left third distal interphalangeal was\\nwarm to touch.  The patient without lower extremity edema.\\nThere was mild palmar erythema.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories\\nrevealed white blood cell count was 5.1, hematocrit was 34.3,\\nplatelets were 231.  Electrolytes were within normal limits.\\nPT was 17.4, PTT was 32.1, INR was 2.  Creatine kinases and\\ntroponin were normal times three.  ALT was 22, AST was 32,\\namylase was 83, lipase was 93.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT revealed left lung base with a small\\nnodule.  Splenic calcifications.  Normal aorta, celiac,\\nsuperior mesenteric artery, and internal mammary artery\\ntakeoff.  No aneurysm.\\n\\nElectrocardiogram was notable for nonsloping ST-T wave\\nchanges, poor progression in V1 and V2, generally low\\nvoltage.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient's primary issue\\nduring her hospitalization was her chest pain.  She typically\\nhad three episodes of severe debilitating chest pain per day\\nduring her admission.  She described these as 7/10 chest pain\\nin general, radiating to her back, and were accompanied with\\nnausea and dry heaves.  On each occasion during her\\nadmission, an electrocardiogram was obtained, and there was\\nnever any change in her electrocardiograms.\\n\\nHer pain generally resolved with several sublingual\\nnitroglycerin coupled with 2 mg to 4 mg of intravenous\\nDilaudid, and Zofran and Ativan were also frequently\\nrequired.  Her chest pain in general did not seem to improve\\nduring her admission, in that it did not decrease in\\nfrequency or severity.  Her histamine blockade was increased\\nwith her Gastrocrom, and she was started on steroids,\\nhowever, it became evident during her admission that she was\\nthrowing away her prednisone.\\n\\nCardiology was involved and did not feel that her chest pain\\nwas consistent with a cardiac etiology.  An echocardiogram\\nwas obtained and showed that her ejection fraction had\\nrebounded to 75% from 35% on her last admission.\\n\\nAn Allergy consultation was obtained, and there was some\\nsuggestion that histamine release could cause coronary with\\nmuscle spasm; however, this was felt to be somewhat less\\nlikely.   Additionally as her repeat electrocardiogram showed\\nno evidence of ischemia with chest pain, and her cardiac\\nfunction was normal, we felt the patient's cardiovascular\\nstatus was good.\\n\\n2.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  Possible gastrointestinal\\netiology for the patient's symptoms were closely considered.\\nThis was felt to be somewhat likely given the patient's\\nhistory of gastrointestinal manifestations of mast cell\\nactivation.  There was suspicion for esophageal spasm given\\nthe resolution of symptoms with nitroglycerin in the presence\\nof no electrocardiogram changes.\\n\\nGI was involved and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was\\nperformed which was grossly normal.  However, biopsy\\nspecimens were taken.  The patient may still require\\n[**Doctor Last Name **] test in the future for possible esophageal spasm.\\n\\nIn terms of the patient's lower gastrointestinal bleed, a\\nflexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and revealed only\\nhemorrhoids.  The patient's abdominal pain was well\\ncontrolled throughout her admission with histamine blockade\\nand Gastrocrom.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  As the patient's chest pain episodes\\ncontinued throughout her admission, she began to experience\\nincreasing respiratory distress with these episodes.  Her\\nrespiratory issues consisted of wheezing during her chest\\npain episodes and were worrisome for anaphylaxis.\\n\\nOn two occasions, the patient received epinephrine which\\nseemed to help symptoms to some degree.  However, on the\\nsecond occasion, after receiving racemic epinephrine and\\nstill having some stridorous sounds worrisome for\\nanaphylaxis, the patient was transferred to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit for observation.  She was closely\\nobserved there but did not have any further events and was\\nstable from a pulmonary perspective.  It was unclear to what\\nextent her wheezing was related to histamine release and\\nanaphylaxis, as there also seemed to be some anxiety\\ncomponent that was worsening these episodes.\\n\\nHer arterial blood gas after the episode causing the\\nMedical Intensive Care Unit transfer was consistent with some\\ndegree of a panic attack.  The patient was started on a\\nchromone inhaler in house.\\n\\n4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's mastocytosis syndrome was\\naggressively treated with antihistamines and cromolyn.\\nPrednisone was started on admission; however, the patient\\nrefused this medication.  A tryptase alpha and beta were\\nsent.  A 24-hour urine was performed; however, it was unclear\\nto what extent to the 24-hour urine was collected properly.\\n\\n5.  PSYCHIATRY:  On the day prior to discharge, the patient\\nbegan to act in a hypomanic state.  Her speech became\\ntangential and pressured.  The patient was adamant that she\\nwanted to be discharged to home.  It was revealed that the\\npatient had been taking her own Effexor 75 mg p.o. q.d.\\nthroughout the hospital stay.\\n\\nPsychiatry was consulted, and it was felt that it was very\\nlikely that the patient's mood and anxiety contributed in\\nsome way to the patient's physical symptoms.  Additionally,\\nPsychiatry felt that she had no active psychiatric problem\\nthat should delay her discharge.  She was to follow up with\\noutpatient psychiatric treaters.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.  Mastocytosis syndrome.\\n2.  Internal hemorrhoids.\\n3.  Anxiety.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  [**Doctor First Name **] 180 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\n 2.
